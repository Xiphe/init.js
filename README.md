xiphe-init.js
=============

Basic js functions for namespacing, loose dependencies, asynchronous loading and jQuery plugins.


Namespace
---------
> _mixed_ **namespace** ( _string_ objectPath [, _mixed_ value ] [, _boolean_ overwrite = false ] );

---

#### Case 1: Set a value into a nested object.
```js
var ipsm = namespace('foo.bar.lorem', 'ipsum');
```
Is short for:

```js
var ipsm = 'ipsum';
window.foo = {
  bar: {
    lorem: ipsm
  }
};
```
But existent values will not be overwritten and existent objects will be extended.
Overwriting is disabled by default. To replace 'ipsum' with 'dolor' the third parameter
has to be `true`.
```js
namespace('foo.bar.lorem', 'dolor', true);
```

#### Case 2: Get a value from a nested object.
```js
namespace('foo.bar.lorem');
```
Will return "ipsum".
```js
namespace('not.set.jet');
```
Will return `undefined` but will not throw an error if `not` or `set` are not defined jet.

#### Error Case 1: Don't use middle tokens that are not objects or functions.
```js
var foo = 'This is a string.';
namespace('foo.bar', 'lorem');
```
This will throw an error and return `undefined` because foo is not an object or function.
Passing `true` as the third parameter will not suppress this error - you should handle
that by yourself. 


Wait Until
----------
> _undefined_ **xiphe.wait.until** ( _string_ module, _function_ callback [, _integer_ intervall = 10 ] [, _integer_ patience = 3000 ] [, _boolean_ continueOnError = true] );

---

This tool is collecting `callbacks` that will be fired once the `module` stops being
undefined. If the module is already defined, the callback is fired instantly.  
This comes handy when dealing with asynchronous loading and loose dependencies.

#### Example
```js
var foo;
xiphe.wait.until('foo', function(module) {
  console.log("Foo is now available and it's value is "+module);
});
window.setTimeout(function() { foo = 'bar'; }, 100);
```
This will print "Foo is now available and it's value is bar" into the console after
100 miliseconds.

#### Intervall
In the background, a loop is started for each module. The time between two checks can be
adjusted by setting the third value.  
```js
xiphe.wait.until('foo.bar', function(module) {
  console.log("foo.bar is now available");
}, 1000 /* Default: 10 */);
var foo = { bar: 'lorem' };
```
"foo.bar is now available" will be printed after one second.

#### Patience
To keep the number of loops low, this tool will abort after 3 seconds by default.
This can be changed globally by setting the number of milliseconds until aborting into
`xiphe.wait.patience`. (-1 will never abort).
```js
xiphe.wait.patience = 6000; // 6 Seconds, Default: 3000
```
A single call accepts patience as the forth parameter and will prefer this value to
the global one.
```js
xiphe.wait.until(
	'foo.mooh',
	function(module) {
  		console.log("foo.mooh is now available");
	},
	10,
	100
);

window.setTimeout(function() { foo = { mooh: 'dolor' }; }, 200);
```
This will put the following error into the console: 'Module "foo.bar" not found in 0.1
seconds - aborting!'

#### Continue on Error
By default, the registered callbacks will be fired even if the module has not been found
within the given patience (Loose Dependency Mode). By setting the value of
`xiphe.wait.continueOnError`, this behavior can be changed globally.
```js
xiphe.wait.continueOnError = false; // Default: true
```

This behavior can also be changed individually by passing a boolean as the fifth
parameter.
```js
xiphe.wait.until(
	'foo.maeh',
	function(module) {
  		console.log("This will never be executed.");
	},
	10,
	100,
	false
);
```
